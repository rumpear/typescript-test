It was good to see we continued to create a lot of scoring opportunities. \n\"We have had three games in a row where we have only, by our high standards, scored one goal in each game. That's why I think it was important from a self-confidence perspective to put a few more of the opportunities away today.\"\nVictory briefly took Arsenal level on points with leaders Chelsea but the Blues re-established a three-point cushion by beating Reading 3-2 later on Sunday.\nEidevall's side still hold a game in hand over their London rivals - and the two sides meet in their first game of 2023 when Arsenal host Chelsea on 15 January.\nThis win was an eighth successive away triumph in the WSL for Arsenal, who always looked in control after cancelling out the early deficit, even if sixth-placed Villa did provide spirited opposition throughout.\n\"All in all, I think we're in a great position in the league and now we need to focus on the Champions League,\" added Eidevall, whose side face Lyon and Zurich in their final two group games before Christmas.\nAt the final whistle at Villa Park, both Arsenal and Chelsea had identical records of eight wins and just one defeat from nine WSL matches this term.\nThat suggests this season's title race will be just as tight as last year when Chelsea pipped the Gunners by just a point. Perhaps it will be even tighter this time, with the two Manchester clubs not far behind.\nLast season, Arsenal were left to rue a surprise defeat at relegated Birmingham City that was construed by many to have cost them the title - and they looked in danger of suffering more 'second city' misery after Hanson's sixth-minute opener.\nThe on-loan Manchester United forward took Kenza Dali's pass in her stride before firing a fine finish across Manuela Zinsberger into the far corner from the left-hand edge of the penalty area.\nArsenal continued to look nervy at the back as Laura Blindkilde Brown's mis-hit cross struck Zinsberger's crossbar, but the Gunners retained their own threat going forward.\nHannah Hampton saved well from Miedema before Hanson's opener, while Caitlin Foord blazed off target when well placed and McCabe's 25-yard free-kick whistled inches over.\nThere was a slice of fortune about Arsenal's 26th-minute equaliser as Hampton's attempt to palm out McCabe's cross struck Corsie and ricocheted in, despite Danielle Turner's effort to clear it off the line.\nArsenal led four minutes later as the luckless Hampton punched a corner straight to Miedema, who volleyed home through a crowd of bodies.\nAfter finishes of ninth and 10th in their first two WSL seasons, Carla Ward's Villa are progressing despite a raft of injuries and had won four of their past five games in league and cup.\nAfter the break, Alisha Lehmann and Dali both tested Zinsberger, but Arsenal possessed the greater quality in the attacking third, evidenced by incisive moves for their third and fourth goals.\nLia Walti sent Steph Catley away and her cross was parried for Hampton for McCabe to slot home before Foord's low ball was expertly swept home by substitute Nobbs with six minutes left.\nBoth teams now have more than a month off before their next game and Villa boss Ward is grateful for the break.\n\"Now is the right time - I think everybody needs it mentally and physically,\" she said.\n\"I think this next three or four weeks is a chance to not only get players back but also to bring three or four more faces into the building. That always lifts spirits.\"\nFormation  4-3-3\nFormation  4-2-3-1\nMatch ends, Aston Villa Women 1, Arsenal Women 4.\nSecond Half ends, Aston Villa Women 1, Arsenal Women 4.\nAttempt blocked.
